My name is Chris Baran, but I'm also known as possiblybob. I'm a web developer by trade, though I also enjoy photography, music, and playing rhythm games, like DDR, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band.

### Why possiblybob?

Possiblybob is a name I made up for myself, and its an example of my nerdiness. My progression of names began with my introductory C++ class back in college. When my professor would write sample code for problems from the textbook, he would always use variable names like **foo** and **bar,** as they're fairly standard variable names in the industry. Whenever I'd work on problems for homework, I'd always end up using **bob** instead, since I found it easier to type.

After a few weeks of class, I learned about the principle of negation. In C++, you can negate a value or variable by placing an exclamation point (**!**) in front of it. Since I used **bob** quite often, I decided that I would take **!bob** (Not Bob) as my handle when playing video games in the monthly LAN parties hosted at college.

More often than not, people would misread my name, and they'd call me **iBob** (like the iPod). I guess it does look rather similar. I decided to spell out the name, and I became **not bob** or simply **notbob** when playing. I decided **notbob** would be my handle, and as such, I attempted to register screen names and accounts on several sites using the name. Since **bob** is used so much on the internet, I found that this screen name was more often than not already claimed by someone else.

I wanted to keep a name that was somehow related to **bob** and the first name that came to mind after **notbob** was **possiblybob**, since it seems about half-way between **bob** and **notbob**. It was available on every site I tried, so I decided to keep it.

To this day, if you search for **possiblybob** on Google or most other search engines, you'll find references to me or to my activities.
